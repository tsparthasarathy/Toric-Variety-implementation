# Toric-Variety-implementation
This repository is an implementation of algebro-geometric object called "Toric Varieties".
Toric Varieties are varieties that have a Zariski dense complex torus as a subset with a torus action that is an extension of the torus action on itself. Such varieties have a nice combinatorial representation in terms of fans sitting in a lattice. If $\sigma$ is a cone in the fan, then the co-ordinate ring associated to the open subset of $\sigma$ in the variety is the semi-group algebra C[\sigma^{\ast} \cup M], where $M$ is the dual lattice. The gluing information of these affine charts is contained in the combinatorial information of the fans.
